##Real Time Preseation API
The purpose of the software tool is to allow a user to pull up the most relevant piece of document data based on surrounding conversation data happening at a given moment. This gives users an opportunity to store web pages as document data, and retrieve those web pages based on some text interpreted as a conversation. The relevance of the document retrieval methods are being researched, validated, and tested by Agustin Ortiz.
